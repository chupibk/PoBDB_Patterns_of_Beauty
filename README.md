# PoB Dataset
A dataset toward reasoning patterns of beauty in image data and construction of visual grammar

The PoB Dataset encodes the compositional patterns based on our defined 15 patterns in images. The PoB includes two datasets: Painting (4,959 images - a subset of the AVA dataset) and Photograph (10,000 images).

The folder includes 4 subfolders:

	- ./patterns_annotated_results: annotated results of two annotators ("junior" and "senior") for each Painting and Photograph datasets.
